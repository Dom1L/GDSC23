                "After preparing a basic model with the features from audio data and gaining an understanding of the metrics for this challenge it's time to use a more state-of-the-art approach. The model we are about to use is bigger and demands more computation power. The purpose of this tutorial is to help you understand the code that we will be using in the next notebook where we will fine-tune the model on the whole dataset. As we want only to get familiar with the model and its preprocessing, we will use a small sample of data in this notebook.  So if the results here seem to be discouraging please be patient, you will see it will pay off in the next part of the tutorials.\n",
                "\n",
                "For this notebook, we'll use the [\u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u2014 (Hugging face) library](https://huggingface.co/). With its help, we will create the train, validation, and test datasets, preprocess the data, load a pre-trained model, and fine-tune it. By the end of this notebook, you will have a basic understanding of the huggingface library and you will be able to train a much more powerful model than Random Forest.\n",

                "For those of you who encounter the \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u2014 library for the first time let's ask ChatGPT for a short explanation of what it is:\n",
                ">\"Hugging Face is an open-source software library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, machine translation, and question-answering. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to pre-trained language models, including state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3 and BERT, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy NLP applications. The library also includes a range of tools for fine-tuning and adapting pre-trained models to specific NLP tasks, as well as for training new models from scratch. Hugging Face has become popular in the NLP community due to its ease of use, flexibility, and strong community support. It is widely used in industry and academia for a variety of NLP applications.\"\n",
                "\n",
                "Hmm... that's a good start, but honestly, a more accurate explanation would include information that apart from NLP-oriented models the library provides state-of-the-art solutions for a variety of different Data Science tasks, such as Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning aaaaand **Audio Processing**!\n",
                "\n",
                "Nevertheless, backed up by the ChatGPT promise of \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u2014 simplicity let's try to use the library to create an audio dataset, preprocess it, and finally fine-tune one of many available models on our classification task. The list of all available audio classifiers can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=audio-classification&sort=downloads), for starters we'll try to use one of the most popular ones - [Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/audio-spectrogram-transformer#audio-spectrogram-transformer).\n",
                "\n",

While this is the same type of data, it is very different from what we are working with. The AudioSet consists of clips from YouTube, which are nowhere close to insects' sound recordings. This is why we need to perform some preprocessing steps in order to reliably fine-tune the model for our purpose. Let's see what the \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u2014 [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/audio-spectrogram-transformer#overview) of the AST model tells us.\n",

The input to the AST model is a spectrogram, so we need to calculate the stats not from the \"raw\" amplitude arrays that we've just loaded, but from their respective spectrograms. Luckily the *ASTFeatureExtractor* does just that - it extracts the features from the audio data that are needed for the model, which are the spectrogram arrays. Setting the *do_normalize* argument to *False* will return the spectrograms without performing the normalization on them, so that we can calculate the relevant stats.\n",

This happens to be the sampling rate of the AudioSet dataset on which the model was pre-trained. As we know from inspecting our dataset in the EDA phase and from the information displayed from looking at the first row of the train and validation sets our sampling rate is higher than that. In order to use the AST model we need first to resample our dataset to the sampling rate of 16 000 and only then calculate the statistics of such preprocessed audio set.\n",
